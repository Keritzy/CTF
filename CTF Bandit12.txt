#the clues say we need to create a directory under /tmp and use mkdir
#first I want to start a reverse file and put it into a bin file
#I am naming the bin file, honeybee.bin though it can be called anything
#this file can be used repeatedly as a source to revert the data.txt file
#honeybee.bin will now serve as anything relating to data.txt info now

#next we will use file to also work with honeybee.bin 
#to find out what compression method was used on data.txt

file honeybee.bin

#we now find out gzip is how data.txt/honeybee.bin was compressed into a hexdump
#we now need to find a way to decompress a gzip file
#this method will use zcat and bcat to decompress
#zcat will start off compressing and now we will
#set up a way for " file - " to be linked to read honeybee.bin
#as we start compressing and decompressing the multiple compressions
#originally done to data.txt/honeybee.bin's hexdump
#using " | " to keep linking more outputs for bzcat decompressions

zcat honeybee.bin | file -

#the output says bzip2 so we must now add bzcat to the extension list
#to decompress


zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | file -

#the output says gzip again which means that we must use zcat again
#because the user compressed the original file with gzip again at this point

zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | zcat | file -

#The output gives us a tar extension of the file locations compression
#for multiple files that are more than 2 to be stored for extraction.
#we will use tar and whatever other extensions zcat gives
#so we can continue to decompress
#we are going to put x0 for the number of times tar has been outputted
#since we only see tar once, we will extract x0

zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | zcat | tar xO | file -

#we see tar again so add it to the chain

zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | zcat | tar xO | tar xO | file -

#we see bzip2 again so need to add zcat to decompress

zcat honeybee.bin | bzcat | zcat | tar xO | tar xO | bzcat | tar xO | zcat | file -

# we now see something called " ASCII text "
#since we see text that must mean 
#we have reached the honeybee.bin/data.txt to a readable file
#we will now take out " | file - " so we can decompress this chaing
#and read it without
#linking anything else to the chain
