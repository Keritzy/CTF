#Level 13

#instead of looking for a password, we need to look for the ssh key
#to log into the next next level
#to look into this level there needs to be an understanding
#of public and private keys
#as well as key based ssh logins
#so first we need to login and use the password
#then we need to see the ssh private key for this level

ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220 -l bandit13

#now we type in the was to see the private key

cat sshkey.private

#we now see the private key which is an encryption code
#we do not need to decrypt the key, but use it to unlock the local host

ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private 

#this lets us use the local host and the private key to
#get to the bandit14 user
#but we still need the password
#the location of the password was already given to us in the instructions
#now we just need to cat it to see if the password is there

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

#there's the password " 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e "
#now lets use the private key and bandit14's login and ssh key

ssh -i ./sskey.private bandit14@localhost
