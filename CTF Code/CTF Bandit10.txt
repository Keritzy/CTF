#Using cat data.txt you will get a long code which is something encoded

cat data.txt

#The encode will be

#The instructions say that this encode uses base64 which is a form of encryption
#We need to decode the encryption using " base64 -d data.txt "

base64 -d data.txt

#It worked! The code decrypts to " IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR "
