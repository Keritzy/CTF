#this file is unreadable except for some strings that have "=" in it. 
#there is a way to use strings, but I will use grep
#to use grep, you will need to use "-a" which can read text files
#so the overall code would be " grep -a == data.txt "

grep -a == data.txt

#the password shows up a couple of times using "="
#but only one that shows a line of text that could be readable
