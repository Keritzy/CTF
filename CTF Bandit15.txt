#For this level we gotta know some openssl
#using the reading material offered we can see which steps to take next
# https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/ch-testing-with-openssl.html
#using the connection to ssl code from the website
#we can change the code given to feistyduck's website to instead 
#the localhost similar to the last level but with 30001

openssl s_client -connect localhost 30001

#Seeing the code it will give some commands as well as saying no port definited
#lets make try again and make the command more like a port
#adding -quiet to take out alot of the output from the results

openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 - quiet

#it will then ask for a password 
#the password is the same for logging into level
